**Response (200 OK)**

```json
{ "vectorStoreIds": ["string"] }

## Threads

Conversations under an assistant are organized in threads.

### Create a Thread

POST `/assistances/:assistantId/threads`

**Response (201 Created)**  

```json
{
  "id": "thread-id",
  "messages": []
}
```

### List Threads

GET `/assistances/:assistantId/threads`

**Response (200 OK)**  

```json
[
  {
    "id": "thread-id",
    "messages": []
  },
  ...
]
```

### Add a Message

POST `/assistances/:assistantId/threads/:threadId/messages`

**Request body**  

```json
{
  "role": "user" | "assistant",
  "content": "string"
}
```

**Response (201 Created)**  

```json
{
  "id": "message-id",
  "thread_id": "thread-id",
  "role": "user" | "assistant",
  "content": "string",
  "created_at": 1616161616
}
```

### Run a Thread

POST `/assistances/:assistantId/threads/:threadId/run`

**Response (200 OK)**  

```json
{
  "id": "message-id",
  "thread_id": "thread-id",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": "string",
  "created_at": 1616161616
}

```

### Run a Thread (Streaming)

POST `/assistances/:assistantId/threads/:threadId/run` (with streaming)

This endpoint streams the assistant's reply in real time using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

**Response (streaming, text/event-stream)**

Each event contains a chunk of the assistant's reply:

```
data: { "id": "message-id", "content": "partial or full content..." }

```

**How to use:**
- Set the `Accept` header to `text/event-stream` (or use an SSE-compatible client).
- Listen for `data:` events and concatenate the `content` fields to reconstruct the full reply.

**Example (curl):**
```sh
curl -N -H "Accept: text/event-stream" -X POST http://localhost:3000/assistances/asst_xxx/threads/thread_xxx/run
```

## Standalone Threads API

These endpoints provide thread and message management outside the context of a specific assistant.
